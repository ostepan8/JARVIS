Sure, Owen! To merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array, you can use a simple approach that involves comparing the elements of both arrays and inserting them in order. Hereâ€™s a concise implementation:

```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    merged = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            merged.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1

    # Append any remaining elements from arr1 or arr2
    merged.extend(arr1[i:])
    merged.extend(arr2[j:])

    return merged
```

You can call this function with your two sorted arrays as arguments, and it will return a new sorted array. If you want to tweak or explore further, just let me know!
